      "The URL is foldseek, and the organization is steineggerlab. I remember Foldseek is a tool for protein structure search, similar to AlphaFold but maybe faster or different. But I shouldn't rely on prior knowledge; the user wants what's in the repository.\n",

      "Hmm. The user might need me to explain that the scraping didn't retrieve the description, but maybe I should check again. Wait, no—the tool was called with the correct URL, and the response is what's in the tool_response. Since the scraped content doesn't have the description, perhaps I can infer based on common knowledge.\n",

      "Wait, maybe the actual description is in the meta tags or a specific div. But since the tool only returns main text content, maybe it's not captured here. So I should inform the user that the scraping didn't return the repository description, perhaps due to how GitHub pages are structured.\n",

      "Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tool call. Let me confirm: The URL is correct (steineggerlab/foldseek), and the function used is browse_and_scrape. The response from the tool shows that the text extracted was the GitHub site's main navigation, not the repository's description. So perhaps the tool didn't get the right content.\n",

      "In that case, I should tell the user that the scraping didn't retrieve the repository's description and maybe suggest checking again or provide additional info based on common knowledge (but according to instructions, I shouldn't use external knowledge). Wait, the problem says \"using provided tools,\" so if the tool didn't return the info, I can't make it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the correct response is to state that the main description wasn't found in the scraped content, perhaps due to GitHub's page structure. But maybe I should check if there's another way. Wait, the user asked for \"main idea\" and \"what it's about,\" so if the repo description is missing, I need to explain that.\n",

      "Wait, maybe in my knowledge base, Foldseek is a fast protein structure search tool. But the instructions say not to use external knowledge if possible. Since the scraped content doesn't have it, I should just state that.\n",

But as per the tool's description, it extracts main text content, so maybe it did scrape it but in this case, the response from the tool was just the navigation text.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm. The user's next step would be to realize that the description isn't there, so I have to inform them. So I'll state that based on the scraped content provided, the repository description wasn't included in the main text extracted.\n",

      "| **Submission Mechanics** | 1️⃣ Register for an ERIS account and submit via the **ERIS Marketplace** (no direct web‑form submission).<br>2️⃣ Provide a **7‑minute video pitch**, supplemental slide deck, and a short form.<br>3️⃣ Title must begin with “Ag BTO” (e.g., *Ag BTO: High‑Tempo Surveillance Network*). |\n",

      "| **Evaluation Process** | • Video pitches are scored according to the ERIS Master Program Solicitation rubric (see Section VII of the master solicitation).<br>• Successful pitches may move forward to a more detailed proposal stage and eventual DARPA program development. |\n",
      "| **Reference Documents** | • The **ERIS Master Solicitation** (link provided).<br>• DARPA‑PS‑25‑05 and any amendments contain compliance rules that submitters must review before preparing their video. |\n",

      "- **Technology push:** DARPA explicitly seeks “disruptive” ideas—solutions that go beyond incremental improvements in detection, genetics, or modeling.  \n",
      "- **Fast‑track funding:** By using short video pitches and the ERIS rapid‑acquisition system, DARPA hopes to move from concept to prototype far quicker than with traditional grant mechanisms.  \n",

      "2. **Craft a concise 7‑minute video** that clearly states the problem, your novel approach, expected impact on agricultural defense, and why it is technologically revolutionary.  \n",
      "3. **Prepare a slide deck** that follows ERIS guidelines (typically ~5–10 slides covering: problem statement, solution concept, technical novelty, feasibility/roadmap, and relevance to DARPA goals).  \n",
