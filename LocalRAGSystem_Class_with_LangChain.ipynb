    "* Embedding Model: Converts text → dense vectors (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2, BGE-small).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Retriever: Queries the DB for top-k relevant passages via similarity search (e.g., cosine distance).\n",

P. putida and related species are frequently cited for their versatile TNT transformations and served as models in comparative genomic studies .

Some Serratia marcescens and Stenotrophomonas isolates even use TNT as a sole nitrogen source, co-metabolizing it in the presence of additional carbon sources.

Clostridium acetobutylicum, C. pasterianum, C. sordellii, and others have been shown to convert TNT almost fully to TAT .

Although these fungi do not mineralize TNT themselves, their TNT-reducing activity can be harnessed in a two-step process: first, a tolerant fungus (e.g., Cladosporium) rapidly reduces TNT to less toxic amines; second, a white-rot fungus like P. chrysosporium mineralizes those products . This cooperative strategy can overcome TNT toxicity that would otherwise inhibit the white-rot fungus . Litter-decomposing basidiomycetes (e.g., Clitocybula dusenii) have also shown notable TNT mineralization (over 30% to ^14CO₂ under lab conditions) . A caveat for fungal bioremediation is that many of these fungi are adapted to wood or compost environments and may struggle to compete with native soil microbiota in the field .\\n\\n\\n\\nYeasts: Several yeast strains (unicellular fungi) have demonstrated the ability to transform TNT, often via unique mechanisms:'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/danid/Downloads/RAG_personal_knowledge_base/new_docs_to_add/Genomic and Metabolic Insights into Microbial Biodegradation of TNT.docx'}, page_content='• Candida and Geotrichum: Environmental yeast isolates Candida sp. AN-L15 and Geotrichum sp. AN-Z4 degrade TNT through an alternative pathway dominated by hydride attack on the aromatic ring . These yeasts form mono- and dihydride Meisenheimer complexes of TNT (H^-–TNT and 2H^-–TNT), effectively adding hydrogen to the ring and eliminating nitrite . They produce relatively high levels of nitrite in the medium, indicating efficient denitration. For instance, Candida AN-L15 and Geotrichum AN-Z4 were observed to convert TNT into 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) by removing one nitro group . The formation of 2,4-DNT (a compound more amenable to complete degradation) shows that yeasts can channel TNT into known dinitrotoluene degradation pathways . These yeasts also carry out the conventional nitro-group reductions (forming hydroxylamino- and amino-DNTs), but the hydride-mediated denitration pathway is dominant .

Phylogenomics indicated these isolates are novel Pseudomonas species, potentially evolved in isolation to tackle xenobiotic compounds . In general, many TNT-degrading bacteria carry plasmid-borne or unique gene clusters for explosives degradation, suggesting horizontal gene transfer has disseminated TNT-catabolic traits among environmental microbes.

These reactions are carried out by oxygen-insensitive nitroreductases, often classified as type I nitroreductases. They typically use FMN or FAD cofactors and NAD(P)H as an electron donor to perform two-electron transfers without generating radical intermediates. Genes encoding such enzymes (e.g., nfsA, nfsB in E. coli) have been found in many TNT-respiring bacteria. An important example is the N-ethylmaleimide reductase nemA, identified in a TNT-degrading Citrobacter sp. Through integrated transcriptomics/proteomics, nemA was found to be the most upregulated gene during TNT exposure, and its product converts TNT to 4-ADNT and 2-ADNT. Nitroreductases are crucial for initiating TNT degradation, but they usually only remove nitro groups; they do not cleave the aromatic ring. Thus, their activity often yields dead-end aminodinitrotoluene products if no further pathway exists.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/danid/Downloads/RAG_personal_knowledge_base/new_docs_to_add/Genomic and Metabolic Insights into Microbial Biodegradation of TNT.docx'}, page_content='• Nitrite Reductases and Assimilatory Enzymes: Though not directly modifying TNT, enzymes like assimilatory nitrite reductase (NasB) and ammonium-assimilating enzymes (e.g., glutamine synthetase) are vital for microbes that use TNT as a nitrogen source. Once nitrite is released from TNT (either extracellularly or intracellularly), it must be quickly taken up and reduced to ammonia . P. putida JLR11’s genome encodes a high-affinity nitrite uptake system and NasB, which together convert TNT-derived nitrite into ammonium for incorporation into amino acids. Similarly, some TNT degraders upregulate nitric oxide dioxygenase and related enzymes to detoxify any nitric oxide (NO) that might form from nitrite or hydroxylamine intermediates.

Several TNT-active enzymes belong to this group, including xenobiotic reductases and pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase (PETN reductase). These enzymes can perform hydride ion attack on the aromatic ring of TNT, forming Meisenheimer complexes. For instance, Enterobacter cloacae PB2’s PETN reductase (gene petnR, also known as pnrA) was shown to catalyze the addition of hydride from NADPH to TNT, yielding a σ-complex that spontaneously eliminates nitrite. OYE-family enzymes like PETN reductase, XenA/B from P. putida, and NEM reductases have the unique ability to both reduce nitro groups and destabilize the aromatic ring. They are thus pivotal for routes that lead to ring fission or denitration.

Azoreductases normally reduce azo bonds (–N=N–) in dyes, but some can also reduce nitroaromatics or similar structures. A recent transcriptomic analysis of Pseudomonas sp. TNT3 (an Antarctic isolate) revealed an azoreductase-encoding gene as the most highly induced gene (>1000-fold upregulated) during TNT exposure.

While the exact mechanism is under investigation, the strong induction implies that TNT (or a derivative) serves as a substrate or an inducer for this azoreductase.

For example, if TNT is denitrated to 2,4-DNT (as P. savastanoi can do), then the dinitrotoluene dioxygenase pathway (found in Burkholderia and Pseudomonas strains that degrade 2,4-DNT) can convert DNT into catechols and further into Krebs cycle intermediates.

Typically, one nitro group is reduced to a hydroxylamino derivative (e.g., 4-hydroxylamino-2,6-dinitrotoluene), which can then be further reduced to an amino group, yielding an aminodinitrotoluene (e.g., 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene) . Often the 2- and 4- positions are targeted, producing 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT as major metabolites. Both 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT are typically recalcitrant – they accumulate or bind to soil components rather than being metabolized fully . Moreover, the hydroxylamino intermediates of TNT can undergo abiotic condensation reactions: two such molecules can combine (via a nitroso and a hydroxylamino group) to form azoxy dimers (e.g., 2,2’-azoxytetranitrotoluene) . These dimers (and their further reduced azo forms) are highly recalcitrant polymers that are not readily metabolized .

Type I nitroreductases (and some OYEs) catalyze the successive reduction of –NO₂ groups to nitroso (-NO), hydroxylamino (-NHOH), and finally amino (-NH₂) groups. For example, TNT is first converted to 4-nitroso-2,6-dinitrotoluene, then 4-hydroxylamino-2,6-DNT, and then 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4-ADNT). Similarly, reduction at the 2-position yields 2-ADNT via 2-HADNT and 2-nitroso intermediates. These aminodinitrotoluene (ADNT) isomers are common end-products in aerobic cultures. Because of TNT’s symmetry, both 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT (and small amounts of 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene) accumulate. Importantly, these reductions do not break the aromatic ring; instead they yield slightly less toxic derivatives that often adsorb to soil or biopolymers. A side reaction of hydroxylamino-DNTs is spontaneous coupling: two hydroxylaminodinitrotoluene molecules can condensate to form azoxy dimers (e.g., 2,2’,6,6’-tetranitro-4,4’-azoxytoluene) .

These azoxy compounds are intensely colored, highly recalcitrant, and represent dead-end immobilization products in many TNT-fed cultures . In summary, aerobic nitro-reduction rapidly eliminates TNT’s explosive character and toxicity by producing ADNTs and polymeric azoxy compounds, but it typically does not lead to full mineralization. However, some aerobic pathways allow further degradation: a fraction of TNT may undergo hydride attack (Meisenheimer complex formation). Enzymatic hydride addition (via OYEs or related reductases) leads to a σ-complex that spontaneously ejects a nitro group as nitrite . For example, Pseudomonas savastanoi was shown to eliminate nitrite from TNT, yielding 2,4-DNT . Once TNT is denitrated to a dinitrotoluene, the ring is less electron-poor and can be attacked by oxygenases. In favorable cases, this can connect TNT degradation to known DNT degradation pathways, involving dioxygenation of the aromatic ring and subsequent ring fission.

Indeed, certain pseudomonads can assimilate up to ~85% of TNT’s nitrogen into organic forms in the cell .

There are also reports of partial ring cleavage under aerobic conditions yielding products like p-cresol and methylphloroglucinol【17†look】, likely via complex rearrangements of triaminotoluene or aminophenol intermediates.

Mycobacterium strain wa1 (initially grown on propane) oxidized TNT’s methyl side chain to 4,6-dinitro-2-nitrobenzyl alcohol, and further to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoate. This likely involved a nonspecific monooxygenase or alkane hydroxylase. The benzyl alcohol and benzoate produced are still highly substituted with nitro groups and were not fully degraded in that study. Another possible oxidative route is monooxygenation of an aromatic nitro group to form a nitroarene oxide or a substituted catechol, but for TNT this has not been clearly documented (such reactions are more common with dinitrotoluenes). Generally, oxidative transformations of TNT by single organisms are minor and require prior reduction steps.

The strongly reducing conditions needed for the third nitro group reduction are usually only reached anaerobically . Once formed, TAT is relatively unstable in aerobic conditions and can undergo auto-oxidation or polymerization. Under strictly anaerobic conditions, some novel transformations of TAT have been observed: studies with Clostridium suggest TAT might undergo a Bamberger rearrangement if partial reoxidation occurs, producing aminophenols (e.g., 2,4-diamino-6-nitrophenol) .

Another observed anaerobic product is p-cresol, which suggests a methyl group shift or ring cleavage of a fully reduced intermediate【17†look】. It’s important to note that purely anaerobic stages tend not to cleave the aromatic ring completely to CO₂; instead, they set the stage for subsequent aerobic oxidation.

TAT is not readily utilized as a growth substrate; instead, it tends to polymerize (auto-oxidizing to colored oligomers) or adsorb to soil. There is speculation that some anaerobes might further metabolize TAT after initial formation – e.g., via deamination or ring reduction – but the exact steps remain unknown.

This hydride-Meisenheimer complex (H⁻-TNT) is a transient intermediate that can either accept a second hydride to form a dihydride-Meisenheimer (2H⁻-TNT) or react with other TNT metabolites. Crucially, Meisenheimer complexes can eliminate a nitro group as nitrite (NO₂⁻), denitrating the ring. The result is the formation of a dinitrotoluene (DNT) or nitrotoluene product. For instance, some Pseudomonas and Enterobacter isolates produce 2,4-dinitrotoluene from TNT by this mechanism.

      "\n",
      "First, I'll scan the context for sections that list TNT-degrading species. The \"TNT-Degrading Microbial Species\" section provides a clear overview, starting with anaerobes and then moving to aerobes. It mentions Veillonella alkalescens as an anaerobe and Escherichia coli under facultative anaerobes. For aerobes, it lists Pseudomonas species like P. fluorescens and P. putida, along with Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Mycobacterium, Rhodococcus, and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should organize these into aerobic and anaerobic categories as requested. For anaerobes, the context includes Veillonella alkalescens (strictly anaerobic), Desulfovibrio species (sulfate-reducers), and Clostridium strains. For aerobes, it covers Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Mycobacterium, Rhodococcus, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key differences between aerobic and anaerobic degradation are well-documented in the \"Metabolic Pathways of TNT Degradation\" and \"Anaerobic Degradation Routes.\" Aerobes typically perform partial nitro reductions, leading to ADNTs and azoxy dimers, with rare mineralization. Anaerobes achieve full nitro reduction to TAT via six-electron reductions, but struggle with ring cleavage. The context also notes that anaerobes produce TAT as a hallmark, while aerobes focus on initial transformations.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll cite specific sections to support each point: the species lists come from \"TNT-Degrading Microbial Species,\" and the differences are covered in \"Metabolic Pathways\" and related subsections. I must ensure all information is directly from the context without adding external facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'll structure the answer clearly: first aerobic bacteria with their traits, then anaerobic bacteria with theirs, and a concise summary of differences. This will directly address the query while adhering to the instructions.</think>Based solely on the provided context, here is a summary of the main groups of TNT-degrading microbial species, separated into aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, along with their main differences:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Aerobic Bacteria\n",
      "*   **Key Species:** Pseudomonas spp. (e.g., *P. fluorescens*, *P. putida*), Bacillus species, Staphylococcus species, Mycobacterium species, Rhodococcus species (e.g., *R. erythropolis*), Serratia marcescens, Stenotrophomonas isolates.\n",
      "*   **Main Transformations:** Initiate degradation by partial reduction of one or more nitro groups (-NO₂ → -NHOH → -NH₂) or via hydride attack to form Meisenheimer complexes, leading to denitration (release of nitrite). Common end-products are aminodinitrotoluenes (ADNTs, e.g., 2-ADNT or 4-ADNT) or azoxy dimers. Some species (e.g., certain *Pseudomonas* isolates) can use TNT as a nitrogen source, assimilating its nitrogen into biomass and potentially producing toluene. Complete mineralization of TNT by a single aerobic strain is rare.\n",
      "*   **Source Document & Metadata:**  \n",
      "    *   Section: \"TNT-Degrading Microbial Species\" (lists aerobes like Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Mycobacterium, Rhodococcus, Serratia marcescens, Stenotrophomonas).  \n",
      "    *   Section: \"Aerobic Bacteria\" (details Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Mycobacterium, Rhodococcus).  \n",
      "    *   Section: \"Metabolic Pathways of TNT Degradation - Aerobic Degradation Routes\" (describes partial nitro reduction, ADNT formation, azoxy dimer formation, denitration to DNT/toluene).  \n",
      "    *   Section: \"Genomic Insights: Key Genes and Enzymes\" (mentions Type I nitroreductases like nemA in Citrobacter).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Anaerobic Bacteria\n",
      "*   **Key Species:** Veillonella alkalescens (strictly anaerobic), Escherichia coli (facultative anaerobe under anoxic conditions), Desulfovibrio species (sulfate-reducers), Clostridium species (e.g., *C. bifermentans*, *C. acetobutylicum*).\n",
      "*   **Main Transformations:** Characterized by complete reduction of all three nitro groups to amino (-NH₂) groups via sequential six-electron transfers (two per nitro group), forming 2,4,6-triaminotoluene (TAT) under oxygen-free conditions. TAT often polymerizes, adsorbs to soil, or undergoes limited transformations (e.g., Bamberger rearrangement to aminophenols, deamination). Some anaerobes (e.g., Desulfovibrio) can use TNT as a terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration and may produce toluene or p-cresol as downstream products.\n",
      "*   **Source Document & Metadata:**  \n",
      "    *   Section: \"TNT-Degrading Microbial Species\" (lists anaerobes like Veillonella alkalescens, E. coli, Methanococcus archaea; focuses on Veillonella/E. coli for TAT production).  \n",
      "    *   Section: \"Anaerobic Bacteria\" (details Desulfovibrio species).  \n",
      "    *   Section: \"Metabolic Pathways of TNT Degradation - Complete Reduction (Anaerobic Pathway)\" & \"Anaerobic Degradation Routes\" (describes pathway to TAT via 6-electron reductions, fate of TAT).  \n",

      "\n",
      "### Main Differences between Aerobic and Anaerobic Degradation\n",
      "1.  **Primary Step:**  \n",
      "    *   Aerobic: Focuses on **partial nitro group reduction** (yielding ADNTs) or **denitration via Meisenheimer complexes** (releasing nitrite). Aromatic ring modification is less common.  \n",
      "    *   Anaerobic: Focuses on **complete reduction of all three nitro groups** to TAT, requiring six-electron transfers. Aromatic ring reduction is a key feature.\n",
      "2.  **End-Products:**  \n",
      "    *   Aerobic: **Aminodinitrotoluene (ADNT) isomers** or recalcitrantazoxy dimers are common. Toluene accumulation can occur if denitration is complete and the ring remains intact.  \n",
      "    *   Anaerobic: **Triaminotoluene (TAT)** is the hallmark end-product. TAT often polymerizes, adsorbs, or undergoes limited rearrangements (aminophenols) but is rarely fully mineralized anaerobically.\n",
      "3.  **Oxygen Requirement:**  \n",
      "    *   Aerobic: Requires oxygen (oxic conditions).  \n",
      "    *   Anaerobic: Occurs in the **absence of oxygen** (anoxic conditions), often favoring multi-electron reductions difficult under oxic conditions.\n",
      "4.  **Mineralization:**  \n",
      "    *   Aerobic: Complete mineralization of TNT to CO₂ by a single aerobic strain is **rare**. Partial reduction dominates.  \n",
      "    *   Anaerobic: Does not typically achieve complete mineralization to CO₂; TAT accumulation or immobilization is common.\n",
      "5.  **Toxicity & Mobility:**  \n",
      "    *   Both pathways reduce TNT's explosive character and initial toxicity. However, the end-products (ADNTs/azoxy vs TAT) differ in mobility and persistence. Anaerobic reduction (TAT) is often a key first step in combined strategies, followed by aerobic treatment for the TAT derivatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Source Document & Metadata for Differences:**  \n",
      "*   Section: \"TNT-Degrading Microbial Species\" (contrasts anaerobic complete nitro reduction to TAT vs aerobic partial reduction).  \n",
      "*   Section: \"Metabolic Pathways of TNT Degradation - Summary\" (highlights aerobic partial reduction vs anaerobic complete nitro reduction).  \n",
      "*   Section: \"Metabolic Pathways of TNT Degradation - Aerobic Degradation Routes\" (describes ADNT/azoxy formation).  \n",
      "*   Section: \"Metabolic Pathways of TNT Degradation - Complete Reduction (Anaerobic Pathway)\" & \"Anaerobic Degradation Routes\" (describes TAT formation).  \n",
      "*   Section: \"Multi-Omics Approaches and Systems Biology Insights\" (under Aerobic Bacteria section, notes rare mineralization; under Anaerobic Bacteria section, mentions TNT as terminal electron acceptor and TAT production).  \n",

They specifically want me to use only the provided context and not any prior knowledge. The context is quite extensive, covering genomic insights about TNT-degrading microbes.\n",

      "Looking through the context, I see several key genes and enzymes mentioned that are crucial for TNT degradation. There are nitroreductases, azoreductases, and various support genes involved in stress response. The context also discusses transcriptomic studies showing upregulation of specific enzymes like azoreductase in Pseudomonas sp. TNT3.\n",

      "For the mechanism of action, I need to extract what each enzyme does based solely on the text. Nitroreductases reduce nitro groups stepwise, azoreductase appears to act on TNT intermediates despite its normal function with azo compounds. There are also stress response genes like those for oxidative and nitrosative damage, transporters to remove toxins, and regulatory genes that activate the pathways.\n",

      "I should organize this clearly with each enzyme/gene name followed by its mechanism as described in the context. The supporting sources are clearly cited within the text, so I'll reference those sections properly.

I'll make sure to cite exactly where each piece comes from in the source documents to meet the user's requirements.</think>Based solely on the provided context, here are the main genes and enzymes involved in TNT degradation along with their mechanisms of action:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Nitroreductases (Type I, e.g., nfsA, nfsB, nemA):**\n",
      "    *   **Mechanism:** Catalyze the stepwise reduction of nitro groups (-NO₂) on TNT to nitroso (-NO), hydroxylamino (-NHOH), and finally amino (-NH₂) groups. This is a crucial initial step, typically using NAD(P)H as an electron donor and FMN or FAD cofactors. They perform two-electron transfers without generating radical intermediates (oxygen-insensitive). For example, the NemA enzyme converts TNT to 4-ADNT and 2-ADNT.\n",
      "    *   **Source Context:** \"Nitroreductases (Type I): A common entry point for TNT metabolism is the stepwise reduction of nitro (-NO₂) groups... Genes encoding such enzymes (e.g., nfsA, nfsB in E. coli) have been found... An important example is the N-ethylmaleimide reductase nemA, identified in a TNT-degrading Citrobacter sp... its product converts TNT to 4-ADNT and 2-ADNT.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Azoreductases:**\n",
      "    *   **Mechanism:** Normally reduce azo bonds (–N=N–) in dyes, but some can also act on nitroaromatics or their intermediates. Transcriptomic analysis of Pseudomonas sp. TNT3 showed an azoreductase-encoding gene was the most highly induced (>1000-fold) during TNT exposure, suggesting it plays a crucial role in attacking TNT or its hydroxylamine intermediates. The exact mechanism is under investigation, but strong induction indicates TNT or a derivative acts as a substrate/inducer for this enzyme.\n",
      "    *   **Source Context:** \"Azoreductases: An unexpected finding... is the involvement of azoreductase enzymes in TNT degradation... A recent transcriptomic analysis of Pseudomonas sp. TNT3... revealed an azoreductase-encoding gene as the most highly induced gene (>1000-fold upregulated) during TNT exposure... This suggests the enzyme plays a crucial role in TNT biotransformation, possibly by attacking TNT or its hydroxylamine intermediates.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Enzymes for Oxidative Stress Response (e.g., Superoxide Dismutases, Peroxidases):**\n",
      "    *   **Mechanism:** TNT redox cycling can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). These enzymes are upregulated to detoxify ROS and protect the cell from oxidative damage caused by TNT metabolism.\n",
      "    *   **Source Context:** \"...genes for managing oxidative stress... indicating TNT exposure generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species inside the cell, triggering defensive responses.\" (Specific enzymes named earlier: \"...oxidative stress response genes – TNT redox cycling can produce reactive oxygen species, so enzymes like superoxide dismutases and peroxidases are often upregulated to protect the cell\").\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Enzymes for Nitrosative Stress Response (e.g., Nitric Oxide Detoxifying Enzymes, DNA Repair Proteins):**\n",
      "    *   **Mechanism:** Nitroso and hydroxylamino intermediates generated during TNT reduction can cause nitrosative damage. These enzymes are induced to detoxify reactive nitrogen species like nitric oxide (NO) and repair resulting DNA damage.\n",
      "    *   **Source Context:** \"nitrosative stress genes – nitroso and hydroxylamino intermediates can cause nitrosative damage, leading to induction of nitric oxide detoxifying enzymes and DNA repair proteins\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Transporters and Efflux Pumps:**\n",
      "    *   **Mechanism:** TNT and its toxic intermediates can be expelled from the cell by efflux pumps. Their expression is upregulated in response to TNT challenge to reduce intracellular toxin accumulation.\n",
      "    *   **Source Context:** \"...transporters and efflux pumps – TNT and its products can be expelled from the cell by efflux pumps, and indeed TNT-challenged cells show increased expression of multidrug efflux systems... genes for efflux pumps were induced, suggesting the cell actively exports TNT or toxic intermediates\".\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Regulators (e.g., LysR-type, MarR-type):**\n",
      "    *   **Mechanism:** Specialized regulators sense TNT or its metabolites and activate the expression of degradation genes. Some are carried on plasmids ensuring pathway expression only when TNT is present.\n",
      "    *   **Source Context:** \"regulators – specialized regulators (e.g., LysR-type or MarR-type regulators) may sense TNT or its metabolites and activate expression of degradation genes... Some TNT-degrading plasmids carry such regulatory genes\".\n",
