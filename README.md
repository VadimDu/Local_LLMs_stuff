# Local LLMs stuff
Code and notebooks for connecting and interacting with Local LLMs, agentic tool usage and RAG practices. The implementation will be done mostly with LangChain framework, and maybe others modules as well. The local server end point is LM-Studio for most cases. HuggingFace API and codebase will be used as well.

At the moment most of the notebooks and codebase in this repository is for practicing and educational purpose, not for production use.
